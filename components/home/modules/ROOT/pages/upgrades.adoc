= Upgrades

OpenZeppelin provides tooling for deploying and securing upgradeable smart contracts.

* xref:upgrades-plugins::index.adoc[Upgrades Plugins] to deploy upgradeable contracts with automated security checks.
* xref:contracts::upgradeable.adoc[Upgradeable Contracts] to build your contract using our Solidity components.

Find all of our resources related to upgradeability below.

TIP: If you don't know where to start we suggest to start with xref:learn::upgrading-smart-contracts.adoc[**Learn: Upgrading Smart Contracts**].
