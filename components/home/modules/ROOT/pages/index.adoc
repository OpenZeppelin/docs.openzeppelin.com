= OpenZeppelin Documentation

Learn about writing, testing, deploying, and upgrading your smart contract applications on Ethereum using the OpenZeppelin tools. 

Our offering includes the most widely used Solidity smart contracts library, a command-line tool for managing your project, several JavaScript modules, and pre-packaged boxes to bootstrap development.

== Why OpenZeppelin?

OpenZeppelin tools have been built with *security in mind*. Since the first release of the Contracts library in 2016, our libraries have been downloaded over 1.5 million times to create tokens, protect digital assets, and power decentralized applications, securing more than $4.5 billion. We also work with top Ethereum projects through our https://openzeppelin.com/security-audits/[security audits service].

== Learn

Comprehensive guides for every step of your development journey:

[horizontal]
Environment Setup:: Install node, npm, and the basic libraries for web3 development
Write Smart Contracts:: Write and compile your first Solidity contracts, using the building blocks from the OpenZeppelin Contracts library
Local Development:: Deploy your contracts to a local blockchain and send your first transactions using the OpenZeppelin CLI
Test your Contracts:: Unit test your contracts with the OpenZeppelin Test Environment, combined with assertions from our Test Helpers
Upgrade your Contracts:: Change the code of your deployed contracts to add new features or fix bugs, using the OpenZeppelin CLI or the Upgrades library
Deploy to Testnet:: Set up a staging environment by deploying your app to a public Ethereum testnet using the OpenZeppelin CLI
Build a Dapp:: Create a decentralized web app using OpenZeppelin Networks JS and Hot Loader, or simply unpack a Starter Kit
Send Gasless Transactions:: Leverage the Gas Station Network so your users can send transactions without having ETH to pay for gas
Go to Mainnet:: All the boxes you need to check before taking your project to production on the main Ethereum network
