= OpenZeppelin Documentation

Learn about writing, testing, deploying, and upgrading your smart contract applications on Ethereum using the OpenZeppelin tools.

Our offering includes the most widely used Solidity smart contracts library, a command-line tool for managing your project, several JavaScript modules, and pre-packaged boxes to bootstrap development.

== Why OpenZeppelin?

OpenZeppelin tools have been built with *security in mind*. Since the first release of the Contracts library in 2016, our libraries have been downloaded over 1.5 million times to create tokens, protect digital assets, and power decentralized applications, securing more than $4.5 billion. We also work with top Ethereum projects through our https://openzeppelin.com/security-audits/[security audits service].
