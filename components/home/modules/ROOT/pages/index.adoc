=== Audits

The OpenZeppelin Research team provides a https://openzeppelin.com/security-audits/[Security Audits] service for decentralized applications, tools, and protocols. You can browse through past public audits in https://blog.openzeppelin.com/security-audits/[our blog]. Go through our https://blog.openzeppelin.com/follow-this-quality-checklist-before-an-audit-8cc6a0e44845/[quality checklist] and mailto:audits@openzeppelin.com[contact us] before xref:learn::preparing-for-mainnet.adoc[going to production] to make sure your project is secure.

=== Ethernaut

Learn more about security in Solidity contracts by playing https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/[Ethernaut]. Every level in Ethernaut is a smart contract waiting to be hacked, and teaches you a vulnerability by having you exploit it - many of them based on real-life hacks! You can discuss your solutions or ask for tips in https://forum.openzeppelin.com/c/security/ethernaut/30[our forum].
