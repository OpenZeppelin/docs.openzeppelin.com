How we organize the Etherisc documentation.


=== Basic idea: 

* Generally, we follow the documentation guidelines of https://openzeppelin.com[OpenZeppelin]. This means: 
* In the repo `https://github.com/etherisc/docs.etherisc.com[github.com/etherisc/docs.etherisc.com]` we put all the general docs which are not specific for a certain code repository.
** General information
** Tutorials
** Architecture…
* In each code repo (e.g. `https://github.com/etherisc/gif-contracts[github.com/etherisc/gif-contracts]` etc) we create a folder `<project>/docs`.
* The basic, manually created documentation which is specific for this code repo is put under 
`<project>/docs/modules/ROOT/pages`
* All solidity code is documented with https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/natspec-format.html[NatSpec] and documentation is generated with https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/solidity-docgen[solidity-docgen] and (automagically) put in `<project>/docs/modules/api/…`
* On each commit, the docs are automatically preprocessed and published.

=== Cross-linking between docs
Antora offers the capability to cross-link between doc sources with the `xref` macro.
For details, see https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/page/xref/[here]


=== Tech stack
* We use https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc]
* Here's a nice https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y7VaiafvidX5CaX90gJz7t6HZqE-dJWq/view?usp=share_link[cheatsheet] with most of the basic commands
* We use https://antora.org/[Antora] to publish the docs to https://docs.etherisc.com[docs.etherisc.com]
* https://docs.etherisc.com[docs.etherisc.com] is hosted at https://netlify.com[netlify]
* Netlify is integrated in our CI/CD workflow. Each code repo has a https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-hooks/[webhook] which is triggered on push and which will notify Netlify to re-generate the doc site.
* We use the Openzeppelin docs template.
