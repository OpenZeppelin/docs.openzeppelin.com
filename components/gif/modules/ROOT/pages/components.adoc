Each GIF instance manages different components. A component is a specific smart contract with a certain core functionality. The components can represent different core objects. +
The core objects are:

* Products
* Oracles
* Risk pools

All components and thus the objects they contain can assume identical states and have the same life cycle but can differ significantly in terms of lifespan.
