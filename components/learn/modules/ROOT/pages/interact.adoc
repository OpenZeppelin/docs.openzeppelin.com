= Interacting with Your Contracts

== what this is

send tx, query values
manual testing but also live interactions

== on a local blockchain

difference from unit testing

why local:
  no delays (instant mining)
  no need to get funds

== on a public network

useful to share with other people
closer to production (e.g. blocktimes, gas price, reorgs)

need to get funds

== on mainnet

security considerations?
