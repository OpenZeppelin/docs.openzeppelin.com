=== The table contents
==== Show only my stakes
Activate this option only to show the risk bundles displayed in which you have DIP token staked. This filter is inactive by default, so we show you all risk bundles. +

==== Instance
Here you can see the location of the GIF instance of the risk bundle. When hovering the mouse over an instance, the instance ID in the form of a hash is displayed.  +

==== Risk bundle
Here you can see the name of the risk bundle. The risk bundle ID is displayed when hovering the mouse over the name. +

==== My staked amount
Here you can see how many DIP token you have staked in the particular risk bundle with the currently connected wallet. You can see the total staked amount by hovering with the mouse over the individual amounts. +
*Supported Capacity (Mine/Total)* +
On the left, you can see the amount of USDT activated by your staked DIP token in USDT in the particular risk bundle. On the right, you will find the total amount of USDT activated overall stakes for this particular risk bundle. +

==== State
There are four different states a risk bundle can have.

* Active: The risk bundle is active. You can stake DIP token.
* Locked: The owner of a risk bundle can lock it. The owner can unlock the locked risk bundle again. You can’t stake DIP token in a locked risk bundle.
* Closed: The owner of a risk bundle can close it. You can’t stake DIP token in a closed risk bundle but can unstake your staked DIP tokens. Once closed, there is no possibility of activating the risk bundle again. A risk bundle can only be closed when all policies collateralized by this bundle have been closed.
* Expired: The lifetime of the bundle has expired. You can no longer stake new DIP token but can still unstake them if you have staked them in this risk bundle.
* Burned: All remaining risk capital, rewards and claims in USDT token are paid out and no more policies are running. 

==== Active until
The end of the lifetime is displayed here. Once the bundle expires, you can unstake all your DIP tokens independent of the bundle's state. +

==== Usage
Here you can see the usage of the risk bundle. Dots in three different colors display the usage of the risk bundle in the overview.

* Green dot: The locked capital in the risk bundle is less than the total supported capital. You can stake DIP token and buy depeg policies in the Etherisc depeg protection web app.
* Orange dot: The locked capital in the risk bundle reached 90% or more of the total supported capital. You can stake DIP token and buy depeg policies in the Etherisc depeg protection web app.
* Red dot: The locked capital in the risk bundle reached 100% or more of the total supported capital. +

When hovering the mouse over the dots, you will see the stake usage in percent, the locked capital in USDT and the total supported capital in USDT.  +
You can sort the table by any information. Just click on the information. Default is sorted by 'Active until.’ You can recognize this by the small arrow to the right of the text.

You can only check this box once at the initial staking. We take over the fees for the staking in a risk bundle only once per wallet. If you want to stake more DIP tokens in another risk bundle, we will take over these costs again at the initial staking. +

==== Gasless Restaking

Similar to gasless staking, you also have the choice of taking over the fees or Etherisc when you restake your DIP token.

Here, you can see how it continues when you pay the fees yourself.
