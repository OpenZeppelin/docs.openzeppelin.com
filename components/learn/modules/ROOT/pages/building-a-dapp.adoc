= Building a dapp

Decentralized Applications (aka dapps or ÐApps) are web applications backed by Ethereum smart contracts. Instead of using a centralized server or database, these applications rely on the blockchain as a consensus and coordination layer. This leads to potentially unstoppable applications: anyone can spin up a copy of the frontend, and freely connect it to the public Ethereum network.

In this guide, we will see how we can use OpenZeppelin libraries such as xref:network-js::index.adoc[Network JS] and the https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/solidity-loader[hot-loader] to build your dapp, as well as how the xref:starter-kits::index.adoc[Starter Kits] bind all pieces of a dapp together:

  * <<network, Connecting to the Network>>
  * <<hot-loader, Hot-loading your Contracts>>
  * <<starter-kit, Kickstarting a Dapp using Starter Kits>>

[[network]]
== Connecting to the Network

When building a dapp, the first step is to connect to the Ethereum network. This usually involves the following steps:

  . If the user is running Metamask, use the injected web3 provider to access the network, and monitor for network or account changes
  . If not, fall back to a public Infura node

To avoid having to code this logic on every dapp, we built xref:network-js::index.adoc[*OpenZeppelin Network JS*] to take care of it. It provides a `useWeb3` https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html[React hook] for getting a `web3Context` based on the logic above. This `web3Context` object provides access to a connected `web3` instance, network information, the user accounts, a function to https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1102.md[request account access], and more.

The following snippet is a small React app that connects to the network using Metamask (falling back to Infura if not found), prompts the user for account access, and displays the user balance:

```js
import React, { useCallback, useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useWeb3 } from '@openzeppelin/network/react';

function App() {
  // Get web3 context via @openzeppelin/network/react hook
  const web3Context = useWeb3(`wss://mainnet.infura.io/ws/v3/${PROJECT_ID}`);
  const { lib: web3, networkId, accounts, providerName } = web3Context;

  // Methods for requesting accounts access
  const requestAuth = (web3Context) => web3Context.requestAuth();
  const requestAccess = useCallback(() => requestAuth(web3Context), []);

  // Querying account balance
  const [balance, setBalance] = useState(0);
  const getBalance = useCallback(async () => {
    setBalance(
      accounts && accounts.length > 0
      ? (await web3.eth.getBalance(accounts[0]))
      : 'Unknown')
  }, [accounts, web3.eth, web3.utils]);
  useEffect(() => {
    getBalance();
  }, [accounts, getBalance, networkId]);

  // Show all information to the user
  return (
    <div>
      <div>Network: {networkId || 'No connection'}</div>
      <div>Your address: {accounts ? accounts[0] : 'Unknown'}</div>

      {accounts && accounts.length ? (
        <div>Accounts access granted</div>
      ) : !!networkId && providerName !== 'infura' ? (
        <button onClick={requestAccess}>Request Access</button>
      ) : (
        <div>No accounts access</div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the snippet above, with just the first two lines we get access to the Ethereum network via Metamask and falling back to Infura, as well as information on the network, provider, and even user accounts - all of this through the `useWeb3` hook provided by Network JS.

[[hot-loader]]
== Hot-loading Contracts

Now that we have a working connection to the Ethereum network, we can start interacting with the contracts we have coded and xref:deploying-and-interacting.adoc[deployed using the OpenZeppelin CLI].

While we _could_ create a regular `web3` contract instance xref:contract-loader::index.adoc[from ABI and address], we will instead leverage xref:upgrading-smart-contracts.adoc[contract upgrades] to hot-load our contracts.

This means that once we deploy and load a contract in our running React dapp, the app will **automatically pick up any changes to the Solidity code and upgrade the contract** during development. The https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/solidity-loader[*OpenZeppelin Hot Loader*] will watch all your Solidity contracts for changes, and automatically recompile and upgrade the contract on the local development network - keeping the same address and state, and just changing the code to the new version you wrote.

NOTE: The Hot Loader is a https://webpack.js.org/[webpack] plugin. It will not work if you are using a different bundler for your application.

To set up the hot-loader, you need to install `@openzeppelin/solidity-loader` and `json-loader`, and add the following https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#rule[rule] to your webpack configuration:

```js
test: /\.sol$/,
use: [
  { loader: 'json-loader' },
  {
    loader: '@openzeppelin/solidity-loader',
    options: {
      network: 'development',
      disabled: false
    },
  },
],
```

NOTE: If you are using `create-react-app`, you may need to either eject the application to modify the webpack configuration, or use https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired[`react-app-rewired`].

Then, just load the contract Solidity file from your client code, which will go through the Hot Loader. Whenever you modify your contract source, the loader will automatically upgrade the instance to the latest code for you.

```js
// Load web3 context using @openzeppelin/network
const { networkId, lib: web3 } = useWeb3Network('http://127.0.0.1:8545');

// Load contract artifact
const Box = require('../../contracts/Box.sol');

// Load deployed instance
const [box, setBox] = useState(undefined);
if (!box && Box && Box.networks && networkId) {
  const deployedNetwork = Box.networks[networkId.toString()];
  if (deployedNetwork) {
    setBox(new web3.eth.Contract(Box.abi, deployedNetwork.address));
  }
}
```

For detailed setup instructions, follow our step-by-step tutorial on https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/building-an-openzeppelin-dapp-with-solidity-hot-loader/1843[Enabling the Hot Loader in a React web application].

[[starter-kit]]
== Kickstarting your Dapp

As you have seen so far, setting up a dapp involves a fair amount of boilerplate and configuration, including creating an OpenZeppelin CLI project, initializing a new webpack client app, configuring network access and loading your contracts.

To kickstart this process, we have built the xref:starter-kits::index.adoc[*OpenZeppelin Starter Kits*]. Starter Kits are preconfigured dapps with several OpenZeppelin libraries, Infura connections, and https://github.com/ConsenSys/rimble-ui[Rimble UI components], ready to start developing right away.

You can start a new project from a starter kit using the `oz unpack` CLI command:

```console
$ oz unpack starter
✓ Kit downloaded and unpacked
The kit is ready to use.

Quick Start
Run your local blockchain:
> ganache-cli --deterministic
Initialize the OpenZeppelin project:
> openzeppelin init app
Go to the client directory:
> cd client
Run the React app:
> npm run start
Continue in your browser!
More at https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/starter-kit/tree/stable
```

This will unpack a preconfigured React dapp, with a network connection set up to both Metamask and the local node. Each box in the dapp shows the information from each connection, each obtained from a different `web3Context`: network ID, provider, accounts, and balance. On the Metamask side, you need to request access to the user accounts before obtaining them from the plugin.

Having this initial setup, you can now modify it to start building your own application on top of it - as you would do in a vanilla https://create-react-app.dev/[`create-react-app` setup].

If you want to learn more about using Starter Kits, `unpack` the xref:starter-kits::tutorial.adoc[`tutorial`] kit instead of `starter`: it will guide you through the process of deploying and interacting with contracts from a dapp. You can also check out the xref:starter-kits::list.adoc[list of all starter kits] available to unpack.
