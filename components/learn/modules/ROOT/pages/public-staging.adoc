= Public staging environment

pretty much this: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/sdk/2.6/public-deploy

== what this is

difference from unit testing
production-like environment

== setting up

choose a network (probably ropsten or rinkeby, ropsten is closer to mainnet but rinkeby is more reliable)

=== connection
infura (explain, get account)

=== funds
get funds (faucet, depends on network)
hdwallet provider

=== configure w/dotenv
use dotenv and hdwallet provider
add network entry to networks.js

== send CLI commands

same as local, but:
  not instant
  persistent forever in <network>.json files
  `from` is important

note that call is still free and almost instant

== programmatic CLI commands

same caveats apply, using loader still works

next steps:
  mainnet
